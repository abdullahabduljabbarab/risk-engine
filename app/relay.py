"""The outbox relay: turning stored outbox rows into published ABS events.

Each row is wrapped in the full ABS envelope before it is sent. Rows are
published oldest first, and the relay stops at the first failure so ordering is
preserved and the failed row plus everything after it stays pending for the next
call. A row is marked published only once the transport has accepted it.
